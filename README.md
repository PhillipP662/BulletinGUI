# BulletinGUI

## Overview
BulletinGUI is a graphical interface for interacting with a secure and privacy-friendly bulletin board system. This project demonstrates the implementation of key concepts from the "Privately (and Unlinkably) Exchanging Messages Using a Public Bulletin Board" protocol.

## How to Run
1. **Start the Server**  
   Run `Server.java` to initialize the server. This sets up the backend required for the bulletin board system.

2. **Launch the GUI**  
   Run `WelcomeApplication.java` to open the graphical user interface. From here, you can interact with the system and test its functionality.

3. **Optional: Without Server**  
   If you don't start the server, you can still launch the GUI to observe how the application behaves without an active backend.

## Features
- Privacy-friendly message exchange simulation
- Server-client architecture using Java RMI
- A simple and intuitive GUI for testing and interaction

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- Ensure that all dependencies are included in the classpath

## Notes
- Make sure the server is running before launching the GUI for full functionality.
- Feel free to explore the behavior of the GUI without the server running.

Enjoy exploring BulletinGUI!
